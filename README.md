# Tokenizer

Project for Principles of Programming Languages where we created a tokenizer for the Jack programming lanuage using lexical analysis.

I'm making it in C. The output needs to be in xml format.

# TODO

Make the output file the name of the initial file we are reading

Make sure that the identifier syntax is correct so that numbers can't be at the front
